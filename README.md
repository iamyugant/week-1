This week's lab is meant to give you a very basic introduction to the Python coding environment. In particular, we will focus on the following:

- Jupyter and Markdown
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Logic
- Packages, Modules, and Objects

## setup

*(As of January 2026)*

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository.
2. Clone this repository using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/quickstart) or using [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).
3. See the [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file. Create this environment locally using `conda env create -f environment.yml` and load it, or use an existing environment that already has these packages installed.
